    GT process

    *Once the students join the session, all the students will be in the common room.
    *Greet the students in common room.
    *Click on the library tool, you will see an option to choose the students name. Before uploading a lesson, the tutor needs to select the student’s name.
    *Once you select the lesson, three tabs will open up with the lesson that you have uploaded. These three tabs are the break rooms created for each student since we have selected their name while uploading the lesson
    If you don’t select their names and post the lesson, then the lesson will be uploaded in common room. So, its always best to select all the students name while uploading a lesson
    *If out of 3 students only 2 have joined the session, you can create break room for both and continue the session. If the 3rd students join in late say after 10 minutes then the 3rd student will be in common room.
    So, you will have to create a break room for the 3rd student alone.
    *To do this, you need to again click on library button then select only the third students name then select the lesson that you need to upload.
    * Once that is done, you can start the session like a normal intervention process.
    *For an intervention session, never open multiple tabs at any cost. Once you have opened the break room for all the students, no matter what do not open another tab
    *Do not poll question if any one of the student is offline. The poll quesitno will be displaved to all the students even if you are posting it in the break room
    * While givng teacher alert, select the name of the student for whom you would like to use the teach alert option
    *For reports, I would suggest all the tutors to fill it in the unfilled report as well before the end of their shift.



    Frequently asked questions
    Where are other students?
    The breakout room feature allows other students work on an independent whiteboard, similar to what you have here! This helps them focus on the lesson.
    Can I use the microphone?
    Of course, feel free to request your tutor to enable the microphone option for you. Remember, this feature is disable in the common room. However, you can do so while working on your independent whiteboard.
    Can other students not see my text or work on the whiteboard?
    While in the breakout room, they cannot! It would just be us working on the lesson. So feel free to bring up your questions.
    Put me back to regular room.
    We're waiting for the rest of the students to finish their lessons before we meet them in the Common Room. You can continue to practice on this question until they do so.
    I have to leave/ Please end the session
    I am sorry, since this is a group tutoring session we are not able to end the session while other students working. You can leave the session if you really need to go.
